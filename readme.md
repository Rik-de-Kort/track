# Track
## What
Tool that you can use to generate apps to track whatever you like!

Want to track your food intake? Create a form with a time/day index.  
Want to track whether you took your medicine? Create a one-button app.

Whenever you create an app, we will give you a link that you can pin on your home screen.
This will give you instant access to your personal app!
The apps allow you to track totals and goals, and your data is always yours, available to download in whatever format you like.

## How
Use some backend script to generate single-page applications, then host those at a specific URL.
SvelteKit for website hosting and app creation.
